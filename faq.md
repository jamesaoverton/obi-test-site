# Frequently Asked Questions

## Will the Blue Jays trade Jose Bautista?
Jose Bautista, impending free agent, has spoken, and you have to admire his candidness about a possible contract extension with the Toronto Blue Jays: "I did not go to them. They asked me a question, 'What would it take to get it done?' and I gave them an answer. ... I felt like for this process to go down smoothly there didn't need to be any time wasted and efforts wasted for either party. If this is going to happen, they should know what it takes, and I told them the number because they asked me."

## Is Justin Trudeau good at comedy?

Comedy, it turns out, is Justin Trudeau's true passion. He hid it well though. Many of us were convinced he was serious about reconciliation and climate, but now, in an open affront to justice and the future of humanity, Canada's Prime Minister is tossing aside those promises*. We've been punk'd by a veritable Ashton Kutcher protégé.
