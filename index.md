OBI helps you communicate clearly about scientific investigations by defining more than 2500 terms for assays, devices, objectives, and more.

It's easy to use with many other 
[Open Biomedical Ontologies](http://obofoundry.org)
, including the
[Gene Ontology](),
[Protein Ontology](),
[Plant Ontology](),
[ChEBI](),
and [many more](http://obofoundry.org).

## How it works

Every OBI term has a textual definition, synonyms, English label, and other information. The key attribute is the **stable identifier**, or IRI/URI, which helps ensure consistent, appropriate usage.
